# inekf
This repository contains a C++ library that implements an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) for 3D aided inertial navigation.

This filter can be used to estimate a robot's 3D pose and velocity using an IMU motion model for propagation. The following measurements are currently supported:
* Prior landmark position measurements (localization)
* Estimated landmark position measurements (SLAM)
* Kinematic and contact measurements

The core theory was developed by Barrau and Bonnabel and is presented in:
["The Invariant Extended Kalman filter as a Stable Observer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1465).

Inclusion of kinematic and contact measurements is presented in:
["Contact-aided Invariant Extended Kalman Filtering for Legged Robot State Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10410.pdf).

A ROS wrapper for the filter is available at [https://github.com/RossHartley/invariant-ekf-ros](https://github.com/RossHartley/invariant-ekf-ros).

## Setup
### Requirements
* CMake 2.8.3 or later
* g++ 5.4.0 or later
* [Eigen3 C++ Library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

### Installation Using CMake
```shell
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake .. 
make
``` 
invariant-ekf can be easily included in your cmake project by adding the following to your CMakeLists.txt:
```cmake
find_package(inekf REQUIRED) 
include_directories(${inekf_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

## Examples
1. A landmark-aided inertial navigation example is provided at `src/examples/landmarks.cpp`
2. A contact-aided inertial navigation example is provided at `src/examples/kinematics.cpp`
